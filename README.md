# IPC

## About The Project
This project was developed as part of the Operating Systems course unit. It includes the code for both the server and the client. This application allows multiple clients, running in separate bash sessions, to participate in different Tic-Tac-Toe server sessions.

## How To Run This Project
In the main directory, use the `make` command to compile both the server and client. You can also use `make clean` to remove the build files here.

In separate bash sessions, navigate to the `server` and/or `client` directories and use the `make run` command for each session.
